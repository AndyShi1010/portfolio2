            <p>
            Hi! My name is Andy Shi. 
            I am a Computer Science student at San Francisco State University.
            </p>
            <p>
            I am programmer with a passion for design. 
            I have experience in Java, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but I also have taught myself UI/UX design. 
            While I am knowledgeable of both front end and back end web development, I primarily enjoy working on front end development. 
            This website lists some of the projects that I have worked on and/or currently working on. 
            Please check them out by clicking on the navigation buttons below.
